Java-Stocks - In progress!
===========
Welcome to Java Stocks - my attempt at doing some backtesting with stock prices from Yahoo

I am currently re-wrting this code after I lost it some number of months ago after a Mavericks update gone wrong. My aim is to calculate the Sharpe Ratio of a given portfolio, which is where I was when I lost the code. I will also add some new features like making url requests in parallel for multiple stocks and add abstract functionality to calculate the P&L for any strategy you could code up yourself!
